== Instructions to Launch Your Lab on the Red Hat Demo Platform (RHDP)

. **Log in** to the xref:#RHDP-Portal-Links[RHDP portal].
. **Search** for one of the following catalog entries:

[NOTE]
====

*RHOAI on OCP on AWS with NVIDIA GPUs*

This option provides a flexible OpenShift and OpenShift AI environment that can be customized to replicate or explore various scenarios.
  
It includes two worker nodes each with an NVIDIA L4 GPU (24GB each), offering capacity for both model training and inference. For example, you can attach one GPU to a Workbench (Jupyter Notebook) for development and utilize the other for model serving.
  
*Author's comment:* Both GPU nodes are the only worker nodes, so cluster resources and services such as pipelines can consume the node memory. Use the large node size if you plan to experiment with OpenShift AI tech preview features.
